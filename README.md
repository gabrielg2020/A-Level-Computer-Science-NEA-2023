# Maze Visualiser
A Visual Basic desktop application to visualise different generation and solving algorithms.

This was made for the **Non-exam Assessment (*NEA*)** in the AQA A-Level Computer Science course. [See Specification](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/specifications/AQA-7516-7517-SP-2015.PDF)

Made and Submitted early 2023.

## Features
- Image input, to generate mazes within images.
- Custom made generation and solving animations with ability to cancel animation.
- Support for multiple generation algorithms like:
  - Depth First Search Backtracker
  - Randomised Prims
  - Kruskal's
  - Aldous-Border
- Support for multiple solving algorithms like:
  - Dijksta's
  - Breath First Search
  - A*
  - Wall Follower Left/Right Hand Rule
- 2D, Quadrilateral Mazes with customisable heights and widths up to 9999.
- Removable of 'dead-ends' in all maze types.
- Customisable maze entry and exit points.
- Customisable background, maze and solve colours.
- Maze statistics showing:
  - Generation time
  - Solve time
  - Draw time
  - Dead End Counter
  - Dead End removal time
  - Total time
- Downloadable mazes.
- Application helper with GIFs.

## NEA Document AKA. 'Write up'
This is a document that was also assessed along side the code. This document goes through my research, analysis,design, code and testing phases of this project. Named *Computer Science NEA.docx* in this repo. Alteratively download [here](./Computer%20Science%20NEA.docx).

## Testing Video
Unlisted YouTube playlist include tests outlined in [NEA Document](./Computer%20Science%20NEA.docx), pages 95-100.

**NOTE: Some videos are quiet... my mum was sleeping...**
